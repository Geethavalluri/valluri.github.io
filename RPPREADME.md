🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction Web Application
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Real Estate Price Prediction System built using Data Science and Machine Learning, deployed as a Flask web application.
The application predicts house prices based on user-provided inputs such as location, area, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to web deployment.

🎯 Objectives
To analyze real estate data and identify key price-influencing features
To build a regression-based machine learning model for price prediction
To deploy the trained model using Flask for real-time predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Machine Learning: Linear Regression
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
