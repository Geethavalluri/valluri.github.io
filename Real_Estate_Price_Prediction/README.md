🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction Web Application

📌 Project Overview

The Real Estate Price Prediction Web Application is an end-to-end machine learning project built using Python and deployed as a Flask-based web application.  
The system predicts house prices based on user-provided inputs such as location, area (square feet), number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and web deployment.
