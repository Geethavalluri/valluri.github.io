- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)  
- Streamlit  

🚀 Key Features
- Rule-based mood detection using genre, popularity, and emoji mapping  
- Content-based song recommendation using TF-IDF and cosine similarity  
- Interactive chatbot-style user interface  
- Real-time recommendation generation  

📈 Outcome
- Songs classified into moods such as happy, sad, energetic, and chill  
- Improved user engagement through interactive recommendations
